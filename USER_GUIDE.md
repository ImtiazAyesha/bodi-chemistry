### **The arrows show you EXACTLY where to move:**

#### **Horizontal Positioning (Left/Right)**

|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| **← LEFT ARROW** | You need to move to YOUR LEFT | Step or lean to your left |
| **→ RIGHT ARROW** | You need to move to YOUR RIGHT | Step or lean to your right |

#### **Vertical Positioning (Up/Down)**

| Arrow | What It Means | What You Should Do |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|

### **"Turn indicator won't go away" (Stages 5 & 6)**
